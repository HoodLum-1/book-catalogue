# üìö Management Service

The Management Service is a Spring Boot application that serves as the backend for managing the bookEntity catalogue. It provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on books and utilizes an in-memory database.

# üñ•Ô∏è UI Service

The UI Service is a Spring Boot application that provides a user interface for managing the book catalogue.
It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete books. The UI Service communicates with the Management Service's
REST API using a JAX-RS Client and generates web pages using Thymeleaf.
